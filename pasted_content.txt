Class, it’s time to move forward with Sprint 1 for the DRS System. You’ve already gathered the requirements and defined the modules, and now you’ll begin the development phase with clear guidelines and expectations.
Key Instructions:

    Sprint 1 Setup:

        Sprint duration: 7 days, starting 15th April 2025 and ending 20th April 2025 at 12:00 PM.

        Each batch (3 batches in total) must:

            Create a Jira workspace using the Sprint template.

            Define stories under Sprint 1, ensuring they are detailed, aligned with the project timeline, and consistent. Dates will be monitored.

            Add me (l201362@lhr.nu.edu.pk) and Sir Zeeshan Rana (zeeshan.rana@nu.edu.pk) to your Jira workspaces as members.

    GitHub Repository Setup:

        Each batch must create one GitHub repository (total: 3 repositories).

        Add me (bilal-os) and Sir Zeeshan Rana (zeeshan.rana@nu.edu.pk) as collaborators.

        Create the following branches in the repository:

            6 module branches (assigned to groups as follows):

                Mobile UI (Camera Module)

                Ball and Object Tracking Module

                Bat’s Edge Detection Module

                Trajectory Analysis Module

                Decision Making Module

                Stream Analysis and Overlay Module

            Staging branch

            Production branch

    Branch Usage and CI Guidelines:

        Each group works exclusively on their assigned module branch.

        Sub-branches can only be created from the respective module branch.

        Implement proper Continuous Integration (CI) workflows.

        At the end of Sprint 1:

            Submit pull requests from module branches to the staging branch for integration.

            After testing, merge the staging branch into the production branch.

    Performance Tracking:

        Jira stories and timelines must be consistent.

        Every group member is expected to contribute actively. Git commits and pushes will be monitored.

        Any member without a visible commit history will face strict consequences.

    Parallel Development:

        All groups can work in parallel as the interfaces and input/output definitions for each module have already been finalized.

Deadlines

    Jira Workspace and GitHub Repository Setup:

        Deadline to create Jira workspaces, define Sprint 1 stories, and add required members: 15th April 2025 by 12:00 PM.

        Deadline to create GitHub repositories, set up all branches, and add required collaborators: 15th April 2025 by 12:00 PM.

    Sprint 1 Completion:

        All development tasks, commits, and pushes must be completed by: 20th April 2025 at 12:00 PM.

        Any commit or push made after this time will result in heavy penalties.

    Sprint 1 Evaluation:

        Evaluation of Sprint 1 will take place on 22nd April 2025.

Important Notes

    Focus on the process, not just the development. Proper Jira sprints, consistent commits, and collaboration are the priorities.

Failure to comply with the above guidelines will result in significant penalties. Take this project seriously, and ensure every team member is contributing consistently throughout the sprint.
