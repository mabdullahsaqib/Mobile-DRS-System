# Mobile DRS Backend

# Installation
1. Create a virtual enivronment (recommended but optional)
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv #.venv is name of folder
```
2. Activate the virtual environment
3. Install the necessary packages
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Note:
Don't push the virtual environment to git as it will just take unnecessary space in git repo.
Use your packages from virtual environment or local packages.
